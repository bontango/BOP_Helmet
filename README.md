# BOP_Helmet
controlling LEDs in BOP (Bride of Pinbot) helmet
Software for my PIC-based replacement board for the original A-14007 Chase Light PCB. This board enables the flicker- and flash-free operation of LEDs in the helmet. It offers the possibility to select the fading in three stages and comes absolutely close to the fading of the original bulbs. (The selection is made via two DIP switches on the board).
